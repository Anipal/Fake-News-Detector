# Fake-News-Detector
LIAR-PLUS is a benchmark dataset for fake news detection, released recently. This dataset
has evidence sentences extracted automatically from the full-text verdict report written by
journalists in Politifact. It consists of 12,836 short statements taken from POLITIFACT and
labeled by humans for truthfulness, subject, context/venue, speaker, state, party, and prior
history. For truthfulness, the LIAR dataset has six labels: pants-fire, false, mostly-false,
half-true, mostly-true, and true. These six label sets are relatively balanced in size.

The code perfroms the following:
1. Binary classification task (true, false)
2. Six-way classification task (pants on fire, false, mostly false, half-true, mostly true, true)
